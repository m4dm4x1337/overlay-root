# Overlay-Root

## Description

### Use an overlayfs on top of a read-only root filesystem

With overlay-root it is possible to provide the root file system with temporary write protection by mounting it as read-only. All write accesses will be temporarily written to the main memory (RAM) on a ramdisk.
For example, overlayroot opens up the following options:
* Safe and hardware-related testing of software without using a VM
* Shared computers that return to their initial state after a reboot 

## Installation

Download the Debian package and run this commands:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i overlay-root_3.0.0_all.deb || sudo apt-get -f install
```

## Usage

Reboot to activate the overlay root filesystem.
